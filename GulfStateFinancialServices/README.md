## Pre-requisites

- Please make sure you have the [.Net 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.

## Running the Projects

- Open the [solution file](https://github.com/jaytarang92/DeveloperEvaluation/blob/master/GulfStateFinancialServices/GulfStateFinancialServices.sln) in your IDE.
- Restore `nuget packages` for the whole solution
- Now you should be able to run each project in the solution

## Challenge Five

I added an extra [project](https://github.com/jaytarang92/DeveloperEvaluation/tree/master/GulfStateFinancialServices/ElectronColorCodeWebAPI) to the solution.\
It's a simple REST API to get ECC properties.\
 Project Name in the solution: `ElectronColorCodeWebAPI`

I don't have a lot of open-source stuff, but I did happen to create a [SMS forwarder/Service Health Checker](https://github.com/jaytarang92/sms-health-check). 

The idea behind this was to make sure my cell phone service was not degraded and could receive messages in the area I was in. There had been a time where I missed a couple of important messages, so this project came about. Also, this was around the same time Azure released their communication service.

Now I use this as a proxy to respond and receive text messages where I wouldn't want my personal number exposed.

Here are some other projects I have worked on:\
/* Remotsy is an IR Blaster for your TV */\
[Golang goremotsy](https://github.com/jaytarang92/goremotsy)\
[Python RemotsyLib3](https://github.com/jorgecis/RemotsyLib3)\
[Python RemotsyLib](https://github.com/jorgecis/RemotsyLib)
